# Local Data Storage

This part handles saving and retrieving data on your device. It's like a mini-database that allows the app to work even when you're not connected to the internet. It manages things like settings, user info, and other data, storing them in a way that the app can quickly access later.

## Why is Local Data Storage Important?

Local data storage ensures that the app remains functional even without an internet connection. For example, it can store your preferences, login details, or progress in the app, so you don't lose anything when you're offline. This makes the app more reliable and user-friendly.

## How Does It Work?

The app uses a secure and efficient method to save data on your device. When you perform certain actions, like updating your profile or changing settings, the app saves this information locally. Later, when the app needs this data, it retrieves it quickly from the local storage.

## Examples of Data Stored Locally

- **User Preferences:** Theme settings, language choices, or notification preferences.
- **User Information:** Login credentials or profile details.
- **Cached Data:** Temporary data to improve app performance and reduce loading times.

By storing this data locally, the app ensures a seamless experience for you, whether you're online or offline.
